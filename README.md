# MandelbrotExplorer
The Mandelbrot set is fascninating for many reasons. What is most striking about it is how it can be used to generate beautiful images.

This is a passion project of mine. My goal is to learn about various algorithms used to compute the Mandelbrot set, and for generating
beautiful images of it. Additionally, it is an opportunity to learn to use ElectronJS to build a desktop application. As a consequence of that,
I am also getting more experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The end result will be a tool that not only allows people to generate their own images of the Mandelbrot set, but also to learn the mathematics
and algorithms behind it.
